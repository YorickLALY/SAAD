READ ME

This folder contains the codes, the neural networks, the normal behaviour and attack dataset and the different results.

 - Attack folder contains the original 16 signals registered in binary file and PNG-file for Replay, Rename and Sis attack and the 8 signals for Fake attack.
 
 - Attack_8 folder contains the 8 signals necessary from each attack for anomaly detection.
 
 - Code_and_Neural_Network folder contains all the code for acquisition of the signals and anomaly detection. This folder also contains the trained neural network.
 
 - data Folder contains the runs with normal behaviour which was splitted into a training dataset and test dataset.
 
 - Masterarbeit_Report_Latex_Folder contains the latex code, the pictures used for the report and the thesis report.
 
 - Report_and_presentation folder contains all the reports and the final presentation.
 
 - Results folder contains the excel file in which all the results were registered.
 
 - Runs folder contains previous the 16 signals from normal behaviour runs done with a different sampling frequency.
 
 - Runs_8 contains the 8 necessary signals for normal behaviour learning from the Runs folder.
